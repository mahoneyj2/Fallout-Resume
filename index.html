				            	As the Technical Officer of WarwickTECH, it was my responsibility to ensure the event was fully realised and executed effectively. 
				            	Alongside the exec team, I organised the variety of sponsors, workshops and food orders for the event, with my main task being to create and maintain 
				            	a strong online presence, collating the variety of resources for all those attending the hackathon, both competitors and sponsors.

				                <p>
				                  	This project entailed working in a team of 4 to create software to identify and collate suspicious trading activity within a virtual stream of trades, as well as creating
				                	a full development stack for presenting the information to analysts, allowing more detailed investigation.
				                </p>
								<p> 
									During this project, we adopted a SCRUM methodology, in which each team member was responsible for part of the software stack. 
									My role was to implement the backend of the stack, written in Java, which would analyse the stream for suspicious trades using a sliding window protocol. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This project was a valuable first group experience and taught me the importance of maintaining good team relations and consistent communication throughout a project, especially when working on seperate levels of the development stack.

									Hackath.org - Modular web-based <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathon</a> organiser tool
								</p>
								<p>
									This project aims to provide a way for inexperienced Hackathon organisers to be able to instantly deploy a completely customisable web framework for hosting hackathons.
									The goal is to create a user friendly experience for both Hackathon organisers and attendees, in which additional 'modules' of features can be  created &amp; integrated seamlessly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some of the cool intended features include:
								</p>
									<ul>
										<li> > Open source and developed using the <a target="_blank" href="http://mean.io">MEAN</a> stack</li>
										<li> > Integrated admin JS 'hackage' manager</li>
										<li> > Skill-based team builder &amp; communications</li>
										<li> > Sandboxed coding environments &amp; challenges</li>
									</ul>
